			<p>
			Thanks for being there when I needed a <br>
			shoulder to lean on, for patiently listening <br>
			to my personal problems. I just want you<br>
			to know how happy am I to have you in my life<br>
			and I thank God for that. Thank you for the<br>
			love and the joy you bring. You've changed my life. <br>
			<br><br>
			You're the only person who gives my heart<br>
			some excitement and thrills. When I'm with you<br>
			I feel like I'm out of control! You taught me<br>
			how to handle life seriously, you taught me<br>
			how to solve my problems and to face it<br>
			without any fear... when I'm with you, I feel<br>
			no fear, not even a single one. <br>
